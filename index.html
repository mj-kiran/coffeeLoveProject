            <h1>
                <p> Types of Coffee Beans</p>
            </h1>
            Coffee is a brewed drink made from coffee beans, which are actually the roasted seeds of the coffee plant.
            The species of bean used, where it was sourced from, and how it was roasted will all affect the taste and
            aroma of the final cup you'll sip. The two main categories of coffee beans you'll come across are Arabica
            and Robusta. So what's the difference?

            <h2>
                <p id="arb">Arabica</p>
            </h2>
            You may have seen bags of coffee labeled "100 percent Arabica." Arabica is the most popular type of bean
            used for coffee. Arabica beans are considered higher quality than Robusta, and they're also more expensive.
            They result in coffee with a sweeter, less harsh taste.
            <img id="arabica" src="arabicarobusta9.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>
                <p>Robusta</p>
            </h2>
            Robusta beans are typically cheaper to produce because the Robusta plant is easier to grow. They have a
            higher caffeine content and taste more bitter than Arabica beans. These beans are often used to make instant
            coffee and espresso blends.
            <h1>
                <p>Types of Hot Coffee Drinks</p>

            <h2>
                <p>Black Coffee</p>
            </h2>
            No frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee beans that are brewed hot. It's served without
            added sugar, milk, or flavorings.

            <img id="blc" src="blck cofee.jpg" alt="">


            <h2>
                <p>Decaf</p>
            </h2>
            Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use several different processes to remove almost
            all of it. Decaf coffee is brewed with these decaffeinated beans.

            <img id="dcf" src="decaf.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>
                <p>Espresso</p>
            </h2>
            Most people know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee, but what's the
            difference, exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about the beans themselves, but when beans
            are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, and they're brewed with a higher grounds-to-water
            ratio than what's used for coffee. The result is a thicker, more concentrated liquid with a bolder flavor. A
            single espresso is a one-ounce shot. It's also the base for popular coffee-shop drinks like lattes and
            cappuccinos.

            <h2>

            <h2>
                <p>BUFF STRICKLAND</p>
            </h2>
            This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but
            coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment with flavored syrups
            like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk. Skilled baristas often swirl
            the foam into latte art!

            <h2>
                <p>Cappuccino</p>
            </h2>
            This espresso-based drink is similar to a latte, but the frothy top layer is thicker. The standard ratio is
            equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. It's often served in a 6-ounce cup (smaller than a latte cup)
            and can be topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon.

            <h2>
                <p>Macchiato</p>
            </h2>
            A macchiato is a shot of espresso with just a touch of steamed milk or foam. In Italian, macchiato means
            "stained" or "spotted," so a caffè macchiato refers to coffee that's been stained with milk.

            <h2>
                <p>Americano</p>
            </h2>
            Order this drink and you'll get a shot of espresso diluted with hot water.
            <h2>

                <p>Café au Lait</p>
            </h2>
            This fancy-sounding French drink is actually super simple: It's equal parts coffee and steamed or scalded
            milk.

            <h2>
                <p>Cortado</p>
            </h2>
            This drink, which hails from Spain, is half espresso, half steamed milk. Unlike many Italian coffee drinks,
            it contains little to no foam. It's typically served in a 4.5-ounce glass.

                <p>Health Benefits of Coffee, Based on Science</p>
            </h1>
            Coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages.

            Thanks to its high levels of antioxidants and beneficial nutrients, it also seems to be quite healthy.

            Studies show that coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of several serious diseases.

            Here are the top health benefits of coffee.

            <h2>
                <p>1. Can Improve Energy Levels and Make You Smarter</p>
            </h2>
            Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels (1Trusted Source, 2).

            That’s because it contains a stimulant called caffeine — the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance
            in the world (3).

            After you drink coffee, the caffeine is absorbed into your bloodstream. From there, it travels to your brain
            (4).

            In the brain, caffeine blocks the inhibitory neurotransmitter adenosine.

            When this happens, the amount of other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine increases, leading
            to enhanced firing of neurons (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).

            Many controlled studies in humans show that coffee improves various aspects of brain function — including
            memory, mood, vigilance, energy levels, reaction times and general mental function (7Trusted Source, 8, 9).

            SUMMARY
            Caffeine blocks an inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain, which causes a stimulant effect. This improves
            energy levels, mood and various aspects of brain function.

            <h2>
                <p>2. Can Help You Burn Fat</p>
            </h2>
            Caffeine is found in almost every commercial fat-burning supplement — and for good reason. It’s one of the
            few natural substances proven to aid fat burning.

            Several studies show that caffeine can boost your metabolic rate by 3–11% (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted
            Source).

            Other studies indicate that caffeine can specifically increase fat burning by as much as 10% in obese
            individuals and 29% in lean people (12Trusted Source).

            However, it’s possible that these effects diminish in long-term coffee drinkers.

            SUMMARY
            Several studies show that caffeine can increase fat burning and boost your metabolic rate.
            <h2>
                <p>3. Can Drastically Improve Physical Performance</p>
            </h2>
            Caffeine stimulates your nervous system, signaling fat cells to break down body fat (13Trusted Source, 14).

            But it also increases epinephrine (adrenaline) levels in your blood (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).

            This is the fight-or-flight hormone, which prepares your body for intense physical exertion.

            Caffeine breaks down body fat, making free fatty acids available as fuel (17Trusted Source, 18).

            Given these effects, it’s unsurprising that caffeine can improve physical performance by 11–12%, on average
            (20Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).

            Therefore, it makes sense to have a strong cup of coffee about half an hour before you head to the gym.

            SUMMARY
            Caffeine can increase adrenaline levels and release fatty acids from your fat tissues. It also leads to
            significant improvements in physical performance.

            <h2>
                <p>4. Contains Essential Nutrients</p>
            </h2>
            Many of the nutrients in coffee beans make their way into the finished brewed coffee.

            A single cup of coffee contains (21):

            Riboflavin (vitamin B2): 11% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI).
            Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5): 6% of the RDI.
            Manganese and potassium: 3% of the RDI.
            Magnesium and niacin (vitamin B3): 2% of the RDI.
            Though this may not seem like a big deal, most people enjoy several cups per day — allowing these amounts to
            quickly add up.

            SUMMARY
            Coffee contains several important nutrients, including riboflavin, pantothenic acid, manganese, potassium,
            magnesium and niacin.

                <p>5. May Lower Your Risk of Type 2 Diabetes</p>
            </h2>
            Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem, currently affecting millions of people worldwide.

            It’s characterized by elevated blood sugar levels caused by insulin resistance or a reduced ability to
            secrete insulin.

            For some reason, coffee drinkers have a significantly reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.

            Studies observe that people who drink the most coffee have a 23–50% lower risk of getting this disease. One
            study showed a reduction as high as 67% (22, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25, 26).

            According to a large review of 18 studies in a total of 457,922 people, each daily cup of coffee was
            associated with a 7% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (27Trusted Source).

            SUMMARY
            Several observational studies show that coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a serious
            condition that affects millions of people worldwide.

            The main constituents of coffee are caffeine, tannin, fixed oil, carbohydrates, and proteins. It contains
            2–3% caffeine, 3–5% tannins, 13% proteins, and 10–15% fixed oils. In the seeds, caffeine is present as a
            salt of chlorogenic acid (CGA). Also it contains oil and wax [2
